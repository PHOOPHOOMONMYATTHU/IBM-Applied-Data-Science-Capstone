◆ Data Collection from API </br>
  For this method, we will do the following process. </br>

    ⦿ Create the custom function to extract the neccessary data </br>
    ⦿ From Custom Theorey extract the data frame that include the requried information</br>
    ⦿ Create the Global Variable </br>
    ⦿ By using the created Custom Function, extract the required data </br>
    ⦿ Put the data into the Global Variable by using dictionary </br>
    ⦿ Then we are going to create the Clean Data Frame by using the Pandas Data Frame</br>
◆ Data Collection using Web Scraping</br>
 For this method, we will scrab the Wikipedia Page about Space X company which include about Falcon 9 rockets which we are going to make the project by using <b>BeautifulSoup</b></br>
